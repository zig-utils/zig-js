# Versioned consumer ABI profiles

These profiles describe exact downstream consumers. A profile is supported only
when its checked-in symbol/type contract, compile-link-runtime fixture, and
revision checks pass. Unknown profile IDs and mismatched source revisions are
errors; zig-js does not silently approximate a moving private ABI.

## Home public C profile

`home-public-c-7ed99c02` pins Home revision
`7ed99c02e50034f869d0db6d487115bb44332fe4`. Its M1 Zig embedding layer declares
50 public JavaScriptCore C functions. The profile records all 50 functions, the
C calling convention, target-native pointer/`usize` layout, opaque pointer
types, enum backing types and values, source hashes, and semantic lifetime
assumptions.

Run the fast checked-in audit and real Zig consumer fixture with:

```sh
zig build home-public-abi-audit
zig build test-home-public-abi
```

When the pinned Home checkout is available, also prove that its revision,
source hashes, and declarations still match:

```sh
zig build home-public-abi-audit -Dhome-source-root="$HOME/Code/Home/lang"
```

This profile is deliberately `public_c_embedding`. It proves only that the
pinned Home public consumer compiles, links, and runs against zig-js. It does
not claim support for Home's `JSC__*`, `Bun__*`, generated-class, JSC object
layout, LLInt, or other private interfaces; those require separate `private_abi`
profiles tracked by GitHub issues #140, #163, and #164.
