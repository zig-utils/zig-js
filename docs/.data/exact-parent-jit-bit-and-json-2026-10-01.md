- logical parent: `ac67db51c988fd2a458f5b7bc44c55dbaed05d2b`
- logical candidate: `8ca0d15b180ff40fa942e21821ac36ddfe4d272d`
- binary provenance: `direct`
- parent binary revision: `ac67db51c988fd2a458f5b7bc44c55dbaed05d2b`
- candidate binary revision: `8ca0d15b180ff40fa942e21821ac36ddfe4d272d`
- shared measurement overlay: none (direct builds)
- zig-gc: `0285ef801dd221a4ae8e88b31a09ae31627657a3`
- zig-regex: `fdd9c2e333ea6ac2fd06d080d939ef7f11d61b1b`
- host class: `diagnostic`
- material-change categories: `cpu_work`
- sampling: 7 order-balanced pairs; no discarded samples
- process quality: every measured invocation used at least 60% CPU occupancy; complete-process occupancy remains diagnostic; before/after snapshots reject persistent competing jobs
- timed boundary: warmed persistent context; one exact invocation
