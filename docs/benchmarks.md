# Performance Benchmarks

zig-js keeps two benchmark families separate:

- `zig build bench` compares the bytecode VM with the tree-walking interpreter and prints a small no-shared-state thread-scaling table.
- `zig build benchmark-comparison` directly compares GC-enabled zig-js and JavaScriptCore in direct single-context, independent-context steady-state, and independent-context cold-lifecycle modes. It reports zig-js shared-realm no-GIL scaling in a separate capability panel.

Neither is an application benchmark or a universal engine score. They are small, inspectable baselines intended to reveal regressions, scaling limits, and the engine paths that deserve profiling.

## Latest JavaScriptCore comparison

The latest saved run is the [July 13, 2026 report](.data/benchmark-comparison-2026-07-13.md), with all [616 raw timing samples](.data/benchmark-comparison-2026-07-13.tsv). It ran commit `c9f68e3299f9184027980e5944e9d5e397cb87ee` on an 11-core Apple M3 Pro using Zig `0.17.0-dev.956+2dca73595` and the macOS 27.0 system JavaScriptCore framework `22625.1.20.11.3`. The machine was on battery power at 66% and discharging; that state is evidence, not a recommendation for future runs.

The saved single-thread medians are:

| workload | jobs | zig-js (ms) | JSC (ms) | JSC / zig-js throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| arithmetic | 80 | 433.536 | 119.881 | 3.62x |
| properties | 80 | 329.675 | 86.305 | 3.82x |
| arrays | 180 | 544.743 | 52.876 | 10.30x |
| Fibonacci | 24 | 474.637 | 62.094 | 7.64x |

The symmetric eight-lane steady-state rows are directly comparable:

| workload | zig-js (ms) | JSC (ms) | JSC / zig-js | zig-js scaling | JSC scaling |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| arithmetic | 662.490 | 209.608 | 3.16x | 5.10x | 4.60x |
| properties | 522.445 | 142.411 | 3.67x | 4.74x | 4.55x |
| arrays | 805.877 | 92.791 | 8.68x | 5.48x | 4.59x |
| Fibonacci | 728.851 | 105.038 | 6.94x | 5.33x | 4.75x |

The single-context JSC advantage is 5.74x by geometric mean across these four kernels. At eight independent warmed contexts it is 5.14x, while mode-local scaling is 5.16x for zig-js and 4.62x for JSC. The symmetric cold-lifecycle ratio is 5.44x, with 4.84x and 4.35x scaling respectively. zig-js shared-realm scaling is 4.91x for arithmetic, 4.78x for properties, 1.71x for arrays, and 0.79x for Fibonacci—2.37x by geometric mean. Read the per-workload rows first: geometric means summarize this exact matrix and do not predict an application.

## What is compared

Both runners evaluate the exact source in [`bench/comparison.js`](../bench/comparison.js). Each workload returns an exactly representable integer checksum, and the driver rejects a run if a checksum changes between samples or differs across engines at the same lane count.

| workload | one job |
| --- | --- |
| `arithmetic` | 100,000 integer additions and modulo operations |
| `properties` | 25,000 rounds mutating four properties on one object |
| `arrays` | push 10,000 integers, then read and sum the array |
| `fibonacci` | recursively evaluate `fib(24)` while incrementing an invocation-local observable call counter |

The compared modes are intentionally explicit:

| label | execution model |
| --- | --- |
| direct single | one warmed context; one exact host evaluation call per sample |
| independent steady | one warmed creator-thread-owned context and persistent OS worker per lane; identical semaphore dispatch/evaluation/completion boundary in both runners |
| independent cold | one newly spawned OS worker and newly created context per lane; thread/context/source setup through context destruction and join is timed in both runners |
| zig-js shared | one warmed context with the shipping no-GIL shared-realm `Thread` API; JavaScript thread creation, work, and join are timed |

The first three modes are cross-engine comparisons. JSC's public API does not expose zig-js's shared-realm `Thread` semantics, so the shared panel has no JSC ratio: zig-js lanes can see one object graph, while the comparable JSC embedding surface is isolated contexts.

## Timing protocol

The runners are separate executables. That prevents zig-js's JavaScriptCore-shaped C exports from interposing on the real framework symbols.

For every result group:

1. Build the runners in `ReleaseFast`.
2. In direct single mode, create/configure one context and make three reduced-size warm-up calls outside the timer, then time the exact same `__benchmarkSelected(__benchmarkJobs, __benchmarkLane)` invocation bytes.
3. In independent steady mode, let every persistent OS worker create, configure, and warm its own thread-affine context. Time identical semaphore dispatch, one exact invocation per lane, and completion waits. Destroy workers and contexts after all samples.
4. In independent cold mode, perform no warm-up. Time OS-thread spawn, worker-owned context creation, source/configuration evaluation, the exact invocation, context destruction, and join.
5. In shared mode, configure and warm one zig-js realm outside the timer, then time creation, execution, and join of JavaScript `Thread`s. Use the same shared path at one lane as its scaling baseline.
6. Alternate runner-process order deterministically for each directly compared matrix row, instead of always running one engine first.
7. Run seven samples sequentially and report median, min/max, and relative standard deviation. Preserve every sample in TSV form.
8. Reject a full row whose median is below 50 ms, then validate the exact expected matrix, sample indexes, within-run stability, and cross-engine checksum equality before rendering any table.
9. Record power source/state and refuse to publish raw/Markdown evidence from a dirty tracked worktree.

The runner does not pin CPUs, lock frequencies, disable background work, or discard outliers. Compare medians from the same host and power state, consult the raw range, and demand repeated evidence before treating a small delta as a regression.

## Reproduce

The JSC comparison requires macOS because it links the system `JavaScriptCore.framework`. On another target the build step fails with an explicit unsupported-platform message.

```sh
# Full seven-sample matrix, printed as Markdown.
zig build benchmark-comparison

# Save both the raw evidence and rendered dated report.
zig build benchmark-comparison \
  -Dbenchmark-comparison-raw-out=docs/.data/benchmark-comparison-YYYY-MM-DD.tsv \
  -Dbenchmark-comparison-markdown-out=docs/.data/benchmark-comparison-YYYY-MM-DD.md

# One reduced-size sample of every engine/mode/workload/lane combination.
zig build benchmark-comparison -Dbenchmark-comparison-quick=true

# Build the two machine-readable runners without executing the matrix.
zig build benchmark-comparison-bin

# Test matrix validation/publication guards without compiling or benchmarking.
zig build benchmark-comparison-test
```

Use quick mode while changing the harness. Run the full matrix once after related changes are assembled; it is measurement work, not a per-edit correctness test.

## VM and tree-walker baseline

`zig build bench` remains the smaller internal baseline. It parses setup once, then times the same hot snippet through the bytecode VM and tree-walker. Its no-shared-state thread table answers whether aggregate compute throughput scales; the comparison suite above adds a second engine, repeat sampling, checksums, and a preserved report.

The latest saved internal run is [`docs/.data/bench-2026-07-04.txt`](.data/bench-2026-07-04.txt). Keep it separate from the JSC report so a VM/tree-walker change cannot silently rewrite the external comparison methodology.
